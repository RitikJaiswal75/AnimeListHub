                </p>
                <p class="text-small">Bleach (stylized as BLEACH) is a Japanese anime television series based on 
                    Tite Kubo's manga of the same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. 
                    The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. 
                    The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a 
                    Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. 
                    His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding 
                    departed souls to the afterlife. The anime adaptation includes original storylines not found in the manga 
                    with repeated appearances and stories containing these original characters.
